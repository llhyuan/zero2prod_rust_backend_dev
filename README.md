As a self-taught full-stack web developer, my journey in tech has been fueled by a relentless curiosity and a passion for coding.

I came across Rust when I started learning backend development. I went for Node.js for its popularity. However, I read the rust book, out of curiosity. And here I am, hooked and want to learn more.

I'm excited to dive deep into Rust programming for backend development! I will be following the book, Zero to Production In Rust, by Luca Palmieri.

Instead of seeing this as an distraction, I see it as an exciting opportunity to approach backend development from a different perspective, ie Rust's perspective.

It's gonna be an interesting ride.
